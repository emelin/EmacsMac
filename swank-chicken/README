A SWANK server for Chicken Scheme.

  http://www.doof.me.uk/2011/01/02/chicken-slime-describe-and-apropos/
for more details.

Quickstart:

1) chicken-install fmt symbol-utils apropos chicken-doc

2) Run chicken-install in the directory where you cloned the repository: this 
   will install the `slime' extension.

3) Add the Chicken extensions directory to your Emacs load-path. Typically this 
   will be /usr/local/lib/chicken/5/

4) Add the following to your .emacs

(slime-setup '(slime-fancy slime-banner))   ; If you don't use SLIME already
                       ; Refer to the SLIME manual for setup instructions

(autoload 'chicken-slime "chicken-slime" "SWANK backend for Chicken" t)

;; If your csi executable is in a non-standard location
(setq slime-csi-path "/path/to/csi")

(add-hook 'scheme-mode-hook
          (lambda ()
            (slime-mode t)))

5) Start a SLIME REPL with

M-x chicken-slime

Note for the describe and apropos commands to work you must install a 
local copy of the Chicken documentation.

If you want to hack on the SWANK server set the following variable:

(setq swank-chicken-path "/path/to/swank-chicken.scm")

This will interpret the code rather than loading the extension. Note 
there is currently a bug in the interpreted version which causes a 
SEGV when viewing local variables in a call frame.
